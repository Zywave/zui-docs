The 500 error is a &quot;server-side&quot; error which means there is a problem with the products' server but the server could not be more specific on the exact problem. In most cases, the user will just have to wait until we fix the issue but there are a few things a user can do as the issue can only be temporary:</p><ul><li><p>Clear the cache and delete any cookies from the page with the error</p></li><li><p>Clear browser history</p></li><li><p>Retry the page by clicking refresh or reload</p></li><li><p>Retype the URL in the address bar and press enter</p></li><li><p>Come back to the page later when the issue has been resolved</p></li></ul><p>Being that a 500 error is &quot;server-side&quot;, the problem is most likely your problem. Some of the common reasons you may be serving a 500 error to your users are:</p><ul><li><p>Permission error</p></li><li><p>Request timeout</p></li><li><p>A coding error</p></li></ul><div class="spacer small" data-v-4e5b2274></div><h3>Implementation details</h3><p>This message is presented as a full-page error that has the Zywave Shell available to the user.</p><p>Our standard 500 error image should appear at the top center of the page.</p><p>The text should be clear and concise, providing our users with an understanding of what caused the error and what their next steps are.
