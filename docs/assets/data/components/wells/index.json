Wells should attract the user's attention more than uncontained text or a toast, but they should never prevent a user from completing their desired action.\r\n\r\nFor more information on when a well is the appropriate delivery system, see [messages.](/communications/messages)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Style variations\r\n\r\nWe differentiate the different styles of wells by both color and icon. These features allow a user skimming the page to know, at a glance, how important the message in that well is. We have four types of wells to help convey a message and each are color-coded with a unique icon.\r\n\r\n### Info well\r\n\r\n![Info well](/images/components/well/well_info.svg)\r\n\r\n- Well color: ZUI Blue\r\n- Icon: ZUI Info\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Warning well\r\n\r\n![Warning well](/images/components/well/well_warning.svg)\r\n\r\n- Well color: ZUI Orange 400\r\n- Icon: ZUI Warning\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Error well\r\n\r\n![Error well](/images/components/well/well_error.svg)\r\n\r\n- Well color: ZUI Red 400\r\n- Icon: ZUI Error\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Success well\r\n\r\n![Success well](/images/components/well/well_success.svg)\r\n\r\n- Well color: ZUI Green 400\r\n- Icon: ZUI Success\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nFor detailed documentation on our well anatomy, view theÂ [ZUI well design specs](https://xd.adobe.com/view/12b92a80-ed5f-4ad2-65c0-b08fc5f0b75f-6488/grid).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Well states\r\n\r\n![Actionable well states](/images/components/well/well_actionable_states.svg)\r\n\r\n![Dismissible well states](/images/components/well/well_dismissible_states.svg)\r\n\r\n### Normal\r\n\r\nNormal state is the initial state of the well when it first appears and before any action is taken.\r\n\r\n### Hover\r\n\r\nHover state occurs when the user hovers over the action with their mouse.\r\n\r\n### Focus\r\n\r\nFocus state appears when the action is currently selected and awaiting activity. This commonly occurs when using a keyboard to navigate.\r\n\r\n### Pressed\r\n\r\nPressed is only visible in actionable wells and occurs when a user clicks (or hits enter on a keyboard). This state only appears briefly while the page/action is loading.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nMix and match features below to get a well suited for your message.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n#### Animated well (default)\r\n\r\nBy default, wells appear shortly after a user takes action so that the user doesn't mistake a well for a static or unimportant part of the page. For example, an employer can't sign enrollment forms on behalf of the employee when making their elections.\r\n\r\nOur recommendation is to only use animated wells when a message is triggered by the user.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n#### Static well\r\n\r\nWhenever a well is present at all times, regardless of the user's actions, opt to use a static and inanimate well. For example, a broker is viewing a past distribution and cannot make changes to the content.\r\n\r\nStatic wells are best used when the message is always present, regardless of the user's actions.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n#### Actionable well\r\n\r\n![Actionable well](/images/components/well/well_actionable.svg)\r\n\r\nAll wells can have one action associated with the message. Actions in wells are styled in all caps and are the same color as the well outline. This contrasts the action against the well message and calls additional attention to it.\r\n\r\nTo not confuse users, we recommend calling out one action per well.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n#### Dismissible well\r\n\r\n![Dismissible well](/images/components/well/well_dismissible.svg)\r\n\r\nSometimes a well doesn't need to be present on the screen at all times after it has been triggered. A dismissible well allows the user to close it. This is typically useful for reminders, success wells, or minimal-impacting warning wells that appear frequently, but do not impede the user's workflow.\r\n\r\nWhen a well is dismissed, we recommend the application remember the user's choice and not show the well again after a page refresh or the back button is pressed to get back to the previous page.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n#### Banner well\r\n\r\n![Dismissible banner in a Zywave application](/images/components/well/well_banner.svg)\r\n\r\nSite-wide messages or messages that appear on more than one page in a single workflow can be delivered as a banner well that spans across the entire width of the page. This is helpful for site-wide messages such as an employer is making changes on behalf of an employee or the user experience is much better in a browser that is not Internet Explorer 11.\r\n\r\nWe recommend you to make banner wells static since they appear on more than one page and push content down. This can be annoying and jarring to users.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Rare situations\r\n\r\n![Multi-item Well](/images/components/well/well_rare.svg)\r\n\r\nMulti-item wells, multi-paragraph wells, wells with headlines, or multiple wells all introduce questions of hierarchy. That undermines the ideal use of wells--delivering a brief, specific, unified message of moderate importance.\r\n\r\nIf you're designing a well that contains the elements listed in this section, there's a good chance that you may have chosen the wrong delivery system (link to messages) or that there are larger, more fundamental problems with on the page with either messaging or design.\r\n\r\nIf you must use these features, however, do so according to these standards.\r\n","component":"zui-well","subComponent":"","zuiLayoutLargerWidth":null}},"context":{}}
