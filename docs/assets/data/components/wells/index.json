Wells should attract the user's attention more than uncontained text or a toast, but they should never prevent a user from completing their desired action.\r\n\r\nFor more information on when a well is the appropriate delivery system, see [messages.](/communications/messages)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Styling\r\n\r\nWe differentiate the different styles of wells by both color and icon. These features allow a user skimming the page to know, at a glance, how important the message in that well is.\r\n\r\n<Spacer size=\"small\"/>\r\n\r\n### Type of wells\r\n\r\nWe have four types of wells to help convey a message and each are color-coded with a unique icon.\r\n\r\n<Grid>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\n#### Info well\r\n\r\n- Bar color: ZUI Blue\r\n- Icon: ZUI Info\r\n- Icon color: ZUI Blue\r\n- Action link color: ZUI Blue\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Info well](/images/components/well/zui-well-info.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\n#### Warning well\r\n\r\n- Bar color: ZUI Orange 400\r\n- Icon: ZUI Warning\r\n- Icon color: ZUI Orange 400\r\n- Action link color: ZUI Orange 400\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Warning well](/images/components/well/zui-well-warning.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\n#### Error well\r\n\r\n- Bar color: ZUI Red 400\r\n- Icon: ZUI Error\r\n- Icon color: ZUI Red 400\r\n- Action link color: ZUI Red 400\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Error well](/images/components/well/zui-well-error.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\n#### Success well\r\n\r\n- Bar color: ZUI Green 400\r\n- Icon: ZUI Success\r\n- Icon color: ZUI Green 400\r\n- Action link color: ZUI Green 400\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Success well](/images/components/well/zui-well-success.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n</Grid>\r\n\r\n<Spacer size=\"small\"/>\r\n\r\n### Shared styles\r\n\r\n- Background color: White\r\n- Font color: ZUI Gray 800\r\n- Border radius: 4px\r\n- Dropshadow #1\r\n  - Color: Well type's color level 600 at 16%\r\n  - X-Axis: 0\r\n  - Y-Axis: 1px\r\n  - Blur radius: 3px\r\n  - Spread radius: 0\r\n- Dropshadow #2\r\n  - Color: Black at 2%\r\n  - X-Axis: 0\r\n  - Y-Axis: 15px\r\n  - Blur radius: 30px\r\n  - Spread radius: 0\r\n\r\n[See base design specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/1ac0f514-8374-4547-79dd-f0f373a4cab2-6cf1/screen/2e5ee5a4-b4cb-483d-a3ea-a5e7a295c9f7/)\r\n\r\n<Spacer/>\r\n\r\n### Sizing and spacing\r\n\r\n<Grid>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\nOur sizing and spacing standards are based off of the optimal length for a line of text. We use that standard to determine icon size, padding, and margins to ensure that all elements in the well are easily identifiable and readable.\r\n\r\n[See wells design specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/1ac0f514-8374-4547-79dd-f0f373a4cab2-6cf1/)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Sizing and spacing for a normal well](/images/components/well/zui-well-specs.svg)\r\n![Sizing and spacing for an actionable well](/images/components/well/zui-well-actionable-specs.svg)\r\n![Sizing and spacing for a dismissible well](/images/components/well/zui-well-dismissible-specs.svg)\r\n\r\n<div class=\"image-desc\">All values are in pixels.</div>\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n</Grid>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nMix and match features below to get a well suited for your message.\r\n\r\n#### Animated well (default)\r\n\r\nBy default, wells appear shortly after a user takes action, so that the user doesn't mistake a well for a static or unimportant part of the page. For example, an employer can't sign enrollment forms on behalf of the employee when making their elections.\r\n\r\nOur recommendation is to only use animated wells when a message is triggered by the user.\r\n\r\n#### Static well\r\n\r\nWhenever a well is present at all times, regardless of the user's actions, opt to use a static and inanimate well. For example, a broker is viewing a past distribution and cannot make changes to the content.\r\n\r\nStatic wells are best used when the message is always present, regardless of the user's actions.\r\n\r\n#### Actionable well\r\n\r\nAll wells can have one action associated with the message. Actions in wells are styled in all caps and are the same color as the icon, in order to contrast the action text with the message text as well as to call some additional attention to the action.\r\n\r\nTo not confuse users, we recommend calling out one action per well.\r\n\r\n![Actionable well](/images/components/well/zui-well-actionable.svg)\r\n\r\n#### Dismissible well\r\n\r\nSometimes a well doesn't need to be present on the screen at all times after it has been triggered. A dismissible well allows the user to close it. This is typically useful for reminders, success wells, or minimal-impacting warning wells that appear frequently, but do not impede the user's workflow.\r\n\r\nWhen a well is dismissed, we recommend the application remember the user's choice and not show the well again after a page refresh or the back button is pressed to get back to the previous page.\r\n\r\n![Dismissible well](/images/components/well/zui-well-dismissible.svg)\r\n\r\n#### Banner well\r\n\r\nSite-wide messages or messages that appear on more than one page in a single workflow can be delivered as a banner well that spans across the entire width of the page. This is helpful for site-wide messages such as an employer is making changes on behalf of an employee or the user experience is much better in a browser that is not Internet Explorer 11.\r\n\r\nWe recommend you to make banner wells static since they appear on more than one page and push content down. This can be annoying and jarring to users.\r\n\r\n![Dismissible banner in a Zywave application](/images/components/well/zui-well-banner.svg)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Rare situations\r\n\r\n<Grid>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\nMulti-item wells, multi-paragraph wells, wells with headlines, or multiple wells all introduce questions of hierarchy. That undermines the ideal use of wells--delivering a brief, specific, unified message of moderate importance.\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Example of a well with a headline](/images/components/well/zui-well-multi-item.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n</Grid>\r\n\r\nIf you're designing a well that contains the elements listed in this section, there's a good chance that you may have chosen the wrong delivery system (link to messages) or that there are larger, more fundamental problems with on the page with either messaging or design.\r\n\r\nIf you must use these features, however, do so according to these standards.\r\n","component":"zui-well","subComponent":"","zuiLayoutLargerWidth":null}},"context":{}}
