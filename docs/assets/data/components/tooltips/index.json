A 200ms dissolve transition fades tooltips on and off the page.\n\n---\n\n## When to use tooltips\n\n- Use a tooltip to help users understand unknown or unfamiliar objects that are not described directly on the page.\n\n- To provide information to users when they need it, and to help free up screen space\n\n- Use a tooltip when a control does not have a text label to explain it.\n\n---\n\n## Tooltip anatomy\n\n![Tooltip anatomy](/images/components/tooltips/tooltips-anatomy.svg)\n\n1. Body - Centered above page element\n2. Text - Centered within Tooltip\n\n---\n\n## Positioning\n\n![Tooltip positioning](/images/components/tooltips/tooltips-positioning.svg)\n\n- The tooltip positioning will default to the top of whatever page element is being hovered.\n- Special use cases may arrive in which the bottom, right, and left tooltip positions may be used if there is not sufficient space to display the tooltip, such as a top bar tooltip.\n\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\n![Tooltip best practices](/images/components/tooltips/tooltips-bestpractice.svg)\n\n- Tooltips should include short, descriptive text that is succinct enough to remain on one line.\n- In special cases, this text may flow onto a second line within the tooltip. However, if the text is too complex or an action needs to be taken, you may need to consider a different delivery option for this information.\n","component":"zui-tooltip","zuiLayoutLargerWidth":null,"supplementalTab":""}},"context":{}}
