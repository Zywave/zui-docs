These messages should not be critical for the user to read and there should be no action included within them.\r\n\r\nInformative, Success and Error/Failure are the types of messages that can be displayed as notifiers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## When to use notifiers\r\n\r\nThe notifier can be used for 2 different kinds of messages, Guidance and Alerts. The following are the types of guidance and alert messages that can be a notifier\r\n\r\n### Guidance - Communicating information with the user\r\n\r\nInformative - Gives the user general information as guidance - such as informing them of an enhancement to the product\r\n\r\n### Alerts - Inform the user about the outcome of an action - either taken by the user or as a result of a system process\r\n\r\nInformation - Gives the user general information - such as notifying the user of a document ready for review.\r\n\r\nSuccess - Notifies the user their action was successful - such as informing the user that their import was successful.\r\n\r\nError/Fail - Informs the user of server-side issues or errors that are not at the fault of the user - such as lost internet connection.\r\n\r\n**_NOTE: Error/Failure notifiers should not be used when the issue is caused by an action the user has taken! These messages should be more prominent such as a well or dialog._**\r\n\r\n![types of notifiers](/images/components/notifier/types.svg)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notifier anatomy\r\n\r\nNotifiers contain a colored bar and icon to identify what type of message you are sending the user. Each notifier will have a title and short message. Notifiers should be on a timer and disappear on their own, but will still have a dismiss X in the upper right corner. A drop shadow should be applied to signify that the notifier is above all the content in z-space\r\n\r\n![notifier anatomy](/images/components/notifier/anatomy.svg)\r\n<br><br>\r\n**Colors**\r\n\r\n- Success - Green 400\r\n- Informative - Blue 400\r\n- Error - Red 400\r\n\r\n![notifier colors](/images/components/notifier/colors.svg)\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n**Icons**\r\n\r\n- 16x16px\r\n- A 24px colored circle behind icon (color matches type of notifier)\r\n\r\n![notifier icons](/images/components/notifier/icons.svg)\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n**Container - sizing and spacing**\r\n\r\n- Container is 400px wide\r\n- Min height: 86px | Max height: 126px\r\n- Solid white background with a 10px colored bar at the top (The color will match the type of message)\r\n- 10px padding from right and left\r\n- 20px padding from top and bottom\r\n\r\n![sizing and spacing](/images/components/notifier/container.svg)\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n**Title**\r\n\r\n- Titles should remain on 1 line\r\n- 16px bold ZUI Gray 800\r\n  <br><br>\r\n\r\n**Message**\r\n\r\n- Messages support the title and give direction\r\n- 14pt, regular, ZUI Gray 800\r\n- No longer than 3 lines.
