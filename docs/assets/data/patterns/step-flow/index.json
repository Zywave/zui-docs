For different size considerations, see [dialog](/components/zui-dialog).\r\n\r\n##### Navigation\r\n\r\nBasic navigation controls include \"next\" and \"back\" buttons in the lower right corner of the dialog, as well as an \"exit\" action in the upper right corner of the dialog.\r\n\r\n##### Number of steps\r\n\r\nWhile there's no fixed number, try to limit step flows to between 3 and 10 steps. Fewer than 3 can probably be combined onto a single screen, and more than 10 might better be served by breaking up the workflow differently (e.g., using tabs, multiple step flows, etc.).\r\n\r\n[See basic step flow anatomy specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/a470f91a-f0f7-4a18-475c-6557e480b3e7-d241/screen/581f31c0-629a-4404-859c-211032f6610c/)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Basic step flow anatomy.](/images/components/step-flow/step-flow-anatomy.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n</Grid>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\n<Grid>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\n##### Intro screen\r\n\r\n- When possible and not redundant, it's a good idea to include an intro page.\r\n- The intro should reiterate the basic scope and purpose of the step flow.\r\n- If completing a step flow will become impossible based upon the user's answer to certain questions, it's a best practice to include those questions on this intro page. That way, the user doesn't enter a flow that's impossible to finish.\r\n\r\n[See intro screen specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/a470f91a-f0f7-4a18-475c-6557e480b3e7-d241/screen/630107ae-33a0-4ee8-b6c4-157c50d42034/)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Intro screen of a step flow process.](/images/components/step-flow/step-flow-intro-screen.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\n##### Completion screen\r\n\r\n- In order to signal the end of the step flow, include a completion screen, which validates that the action has been completed.\r\n- The completion screen can be dismissed by a single action button, and should indicate where the user will land upon clicking it.\r\n\r\n[See completion screen specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/a470f91a-f0f7-4a18-475c-6557e480b3e7-d241/screen/ae18feb7-90a5-4445-9e2b-35d414c824fa/)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Completion screen of a step flow process.](/images/components/step-flow/step-flow-completion-screen.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n</Grid>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Exiting and returning\r\n\r\n- Ideally, a user would complete a step flow in a single, uninterrupted session. However, sometimes, the user may want or need to leave before completing the step flow.\r\n  - Designers and developers should decide whether or not the progress of an incomplete flow will be saved if exiting before complete.\r\n  - When the user clicks the exit button, a dialog will pop up to alert the user of the consequences of leaving (saving or not saving data) and asking for confirmation of the action.\r\n- A deep link into a step flow should take the user to the intro screen or, if there is no intro, the first step of the flow.\r\n- The action on the completion screen always saves the user's work.\r\n- If returning to a saved step flow to edit or review information, you may want to include a text link that allows the user to skip straight to the end, or to the step flow's review page. This link would appear after reaching the end and returning to a previous step or exiting and returning.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Step flow with a progress indicator\r\n\r\n<Grid>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\n- Only use a progress indicator if you know exactly how many steps are in the process.\r\n- Both horizontal and vertical progress indicators are available.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the component itself, see the [step progress indicator page](#).\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Step flow with a horizontal progress indicator.](/images/components/step-flow/progress-indicator-horizontal.svg)\r\n\r\n[See step flow with a horizontal progress indicator specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/a470f91a-f0f7-4a18-475c-6557e480b3e7-d241/screen/052b219a-3df1-462e-bd03-1c186af4e0a6/)\r\n\r\n![Step flow with a vertical progress indicator.](/images/components/step-flow/progress-indicator-vertical.svg)\r\n\r\n[See step flow with a vertical progress indicator specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/a470f91a-f0f7-4a18-475c-6557e480b3e7-d241/screen/6007b49b-4774-4895-9edb-ff6dadefd9bb/)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n</Grid>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Step flow without a progress indicator\r\n\r\n<Grid>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\n- Don't use a step progress indicator if a step flow allows for a user to pursue multiple paths, or if the user may be able to skip certain later steps based upon their work in earlier steps.\r\n- If it's a longer step flow and the indicator would look too cluttered, omit the step flow indicator.\r\n\r\n[See step flow without a progress indicator specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/a470f91a-f0f7-4a18-475c-6557e480b3e7-d241/screen/6844d752-1b8d-419e-b817-ada898a88250/)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-8\">\r\n\r\n![Step flow without a progress indicator.](/images/components/step-flow/step-flow-without-progress-indicator-desktop.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n</Grid>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Mobile considerations\r\n\r\n<Grid>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\nA mobile step flow resembles the desktop versions with a few notable differences:\r\n\r\n- The progress indicator becomes slimmer and eliminates labels to save screen space; only a horizontal version of this step progress indicator is recommended.\r\n- The exit action moves to the lower left corner of the screen.\r\n- A sticky footer containing all navigation actions may be employed for easier, quick navigation.\r\n\r\n[See mobile view with a progress indicator specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/a470f91a-f0f7-4a18-475c-6557e480b3e7-d241/screen/0583b568-d67b-4341-a024-8a0400ef8824/)\r\n\r\n[See mobile view without a progress indicator specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/a470f91a-f0f7-4a18-475c-6557e480b3e7-d241/screen/78eec458-ee6c-457a-a413-9831140f84d9/)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\n![Mobile view of the step flow with a progress indicator.](/images/components/step-flow/step-flow-with-progress-indicator-mobile.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n<GridCol col=\"span-4\">\r\n\r\n![Mobiel view of the step flow without a progress indicator.](/images/components/step-flow/step-flow-without-progress-indicator-mobile.svg)\r\n\r\n</GridCol>\r\n\r\n</Grid>\r\n","component":"zui-step-flow","zuiLayoutLargerWidth":null,"supplementalTab":""}},"context":{}}
