This includes the applications feature level navigation as well as access to notifications, settings, and help and training.\r\n\r\n## When to use Sidenav\r\n\r\nThe side navigation is a base component of the Shell. Having the navigation in a standard and reliable place helps grounds the user experience of all our products, so there should be a good reason if you're not going to use it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What things go in the Sidenav\r\n\r\nThe following are nav items that are recommended for every application, when applicable.\r\n\r\n1. **Home**  - Every application should start with a home link at the top.  This takes you to the home page of whatever application you are in.\r\n2. **Product navigation links** - These are the application links that take the user to the features they have access to.\r\n3. **Notifications** - Application-specific notifications, when applicable.\r\n4. **Settings** - Application-specific settings, when applicable.\r\n5. **Help and Training** - Links to application specific help and Zywave University.\r\n6. **Collapse** - Gives the user the ability to collapse the Sidenav for more working space in the [content area](/foundations/content_area).\r\n\r\n![Sidenav - suite standard items](/images/foundations/sidenav/sidenav-anatomy--desktop-standard-nav-items.svg)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Sidenav anatomy\r\n\r\nThese are the building blocks of the Sidenav.\r\n\r\n1. **Nav Item**\r\n2. **Nav Item Icon**\r\n3. **Expand Icon**\r\n4. **Nav Item (with children)**\r\n5. **Subnav Items**\r\n6. **Collapse action**\r\n\r\n![Sidenav - anatomy](/images/foundations/sidenav/sidenav-anatomy--desktop-expanded.svg)\r\n\r\n#### Icon rules\r\n\r\n- All top-level nav items should have a corresponding icon to help quickly identify the action. These icons are also used when the menu is collapsed.\r\n- Child items do not have icons associated with them.\r\n- For more information [view our icon standards](/foundations/icons)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The three states of Sidnav\r\n\r\n1. **Expanded** - At the **breakpoint of ≥720,** the full expanded side navigation is present.\r\n2. **Collapsed** - When the collapse button is pressed the menu will slim down to show only icons as main navigational items.\r\n3. **Mobile** - At the **breakpoint of <720,** the Sidenav is off-screen and slides in from the left when the hamburger menu is pushed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Behavior (expanded state)\r\n\r\n1. **Unselected Navitem** - Font color: grey-700; font-weight: 400; icon color: gray-800; background color: none\r\n2. **Selected Navitem**  - Font color: blue-500; font weight: 700; icon color: blue-500; background color: none\r\n3. **Expand & collapse action icon** - When clicked the icon rotates 180 degrees.  The icon should always point the direction the action will happen.\r\n4. **Selected subnav item** - Font color: blue-500; font weight: 700; icon color: blue-500; background color: none\r\n5. **Hover** - background color: Gray-50\r\n\r\n![Sidenav - anatomy](/images/foundations/sidenav/sidenav-anatomy--desktop-expanded-behavior.svg)\r\n\r\n### Parent and children\r\n\r\n- When anywhere on a parent item is clicked, the children will appear below that parent item.\r\n- Parent items are used only for organizational purposes to reveal their child subnav items, they aren't linked to pages themselves.\r\n- Parent items can all be open at the same time to show all subnav item for the entire application.\r\n- After a user clicks on a link, expanded navigation remains expanded. Don't close the navigation until the user pushes to close it.\r\n\r\n### Scrolling\r\n\r\n- When the list of expanded items extends the entire height of the viewport,  a small scrollbar appears, allowing the user to scroll the Sidenav.\r\n- The collapsed nav item remains stuck to the bottom and not part of the scrolling section.\r\n\r\n### Collapsing the Sidenav\r\n\r\n- The user can collapse & expand the navigation by clicking the collapse button at the bottom of the Sidenav.\r\n- When collapsed - The content area will respond and make more room for itself, taking up the area that the Sidnav had been using.\r\n- There is no need for the expand/collapse Sidenav function in the mobile state, so the button is hidden.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Behavior (collapsed state)\r\n\r\n1. **Unselected Nav item** - icon color: gray-800; background color: none\r\n2. **Selected Nav item**  - Slideout shows the full name of the navigation item.
