The top bar also provides a space for product branding.\r\n\r\n## When to use\r\n\r\nThe Topbar is a base component of the suite and should be used for every product unless there is a specific reason not to.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Variations of Topbar\r\n\r\nAlthough there is not much difference in layout and componentry, depending on the application we have three different variations of the Topbar:\r\n\r\n1. **Zywave Topbar** - Use when the primary user is a user client. This Topbar has several different branding features depending on if the product is singular in focus or crosses multiple workflows.\r\n2. **Client Topbar** - Use when the primary user is a Brokers client. i.e. Employer Admin or Employee.\r\n\r\n_see more details below_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Anatomy\r\n\r\n### Zywave Topbar\r\n\r\nThe suite Topbar contains many different components which aid in branding, navigation, and other user actions. The components include:\r\n\r\n1. **Zywave logo**\r\n2. **Branding bar**\r\n3. **Search bar**\r\n4. **Application switcher**\r\n5. **Profile manager**\r\n\r\n![Topbar - anatomy - suite level](/images/foundations/topbar/topbar--anatomy--suite.svg)\r\n\r\n#### Adding product-specific branding\r\n\r\nWhen necessary, you can also include specific product branding in the Zywave Topbar:\r\n\r\n1. **Product name** - The name of the product.\r\n2. **Product-Specific Branding bar** - A taller branding bar.\r\n\r\n![Topbar - anatomy - suite level](/images/foundations/topbar/topbar--anatomy--singleproduct.svg)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Sizing & Spacing\r\n\r\n- [Zywave Topbar sizing and spacing specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/41e8cdc3-6df1-4a55-73e3-41b3ea68ac16-37d9/)\r\n- [Mobile Topbar and spacing specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/4b0ad3da-0bc2-429c-5eca-6edee1c1df44-3d3b/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Behavior\r\n\r\n### Actions in the Topbar\r\n\r\n- **Zywave Logo** - Clicking the Zywave logo will bring the user back to the homepage of the application they are in.\r\n- **Application switcher** - When clicked, a dropdown list will appear and show the user other applications they own so they can easily switch between them.\r\n- **Profile manager** - When clicked a modal dialog will show user information such as principle and profile.\r\n\r\n### Searching\r\n\r\nSearch is an optional feature dependent on the application and the users' needs. Depending on the importance or need of searching, this component may or may not be included in the Topbar. The search bar will default to the category that's searchable for the product. For example, content in Broker Briefcase.\r\n\r\n### Scrolling\r\n\r\nThe Topbar is the highest section of the shell, meaning everything in the Sidenav, content area and footer can slide underneath it when scrolling. When the user starts scrolling down the page the Topbar will shrink down to 10px high, allowing for more vertical space in the content area. Once the user scrolls up 1px or more, the entire Topbar reappears.\r\n\r\n### Responsive Design\r\n\r\nOn smaller screens **Breakpoint: <720**, the top bar responds to allow for a better mobile experience.\r\n\r\n1.  The Zywave logo moves to the middle of the Topbar.\r\n2.  A hamburger menu is located in the upper left. When pushed the Sidenav slides in from the left.\r\n3.  The right side of the Topbar should only be used for prime actions per product. Example: Most partners search Broker Briefcase on mobile so, it would make sense for the search icon to be present in the mobile Topbar.\r\n\r\n![Topbar - anatomy - suite level](/images/foundations/topbar/topbar--anatomy--mobile.svg)\r\n","component":"zui-shell","subComponent":"zui-shell-topbar","zuiLayoutLargerWidth":null}},"context":{}}
