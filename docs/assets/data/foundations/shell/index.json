It helps the user understand and navigate the core of the Zywave suite.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n##### Links\r\n[View shell specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/e5a044ff-f756-4d8a-433b-62c78587509b-9391/)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Anatomy\r\n\r\nThe shell includes 4 core sections that surround the content standard content area, Topbar, Side nav, and footer. For a consistent user experience, use all 3 shell components when building applications.\r\n\r\n#### 1. - Topbar\r\n\r\nThe Topbar is the section reserved at the top of the page that provides application branding, suite-level navigation, and high priority functionality such as search. For more detailed information, [view Topbar guidelines](/foundations/topbar).\r\n\r\n#### 2. - Sidenav\r\n\r\nThe Side nav provides a standard place for navigation within a product. Placed on the left-hand side of the site, it lists out the application-specific site features you can click on and access, as well as features like settings, notifications, and help. For more detailed information, [view Sidenav guidelines](/foundations/sidenav).\r\n\r\n#### 3. - Footer\r\n\r\nThe section at the bottom of the page which contains information that needs to be there, but doesn't necessarily demand the user's primary focus. The footer includes trademark, terms & conditions, privacy statement, DMCA, cookie usage, and contact information. For more detailed information, [view Footer guidelines](/foundations/footer).\r\n\r\n#### 4. - Content area\r\n\r\nThe Content area is the body of our applications where all the features and functionality gets placed. For more detailed information, [view Content area guidelines](/foundations/content_area)\r\n\r\n![Shell screenshot](/images/foundations/shell/shell-basics.svg)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Suite vs individual products\r\n\r\nDepending on if you are building a single point solution that will be sold individually or one that fits into our suite with other features of the same nature, the shell can change to accommodate an ideal user experience.\r\n\r\n![Shell suite screenshot](/images/foundations/shell/shell--suite.svg)  \r\n_Example: Shell for the Zywave suite._\r\n\r\n<Spacer/>\r\n\r\n![Shell Modmaster screenshot](/images/foundations/shell/shell--individual-mm.svg)\r\n_Example: Shell for a single point solution (ModMaster).

At our mobile breakpoint (â‰¥720px), the side nav becomes hidden off-screen and slides in when the menu button his pushed.
