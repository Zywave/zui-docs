ZUI is embracing this new web feature to make UI rich and simple components, while supporting as many applications as we can. For everything about Web Components, check out https://www.webcomponents.org/.\r\n\r\n## Why web components?\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the \"what are web components\" section, I just want to detour into the \"why.\" Why not just choose a framework? Or simpler yet, why not just continue ZUI 3.x components?\r\n\r\nWe decided on web components because web components offer something that we otherwise couldn't accomplish: interoperability. The ease of installing a web component, applying a theme, and everything just working (regardless of your application's stack) is something we've not really had with ZUI 2 or ZUI 3. And choosing to just drop Durandal/knockout and create an Aurelia, or Vue, or something else that comes along next year is just repeating the past. ZUI isn't intended to be a framework; it's intended to be a spec and design tool to make your application look like a Zywave product.\r\n\r\nWeb components are the answer to this problem. Not to mention, we get a huge added benefit of being fully backward compatible. You can use your ZUI 2 or 3 components and styles while porting over to ZUI 4 and not have to do a full site regression. There's no more conflict, so the upgrade process shouldn't block development for weeks.\r\n\r\n## What are web components?\r\n\r\nWeb Components is a collection of new web standards that allows developers to create browser-level elements and distribute them to be used in any application. Here's just a brief walkthrough of some of the key standards, but for more information, you should really check out the [Web Components website](https://www.webcomponents.org/).\r\n\r\n### Custom elements\r\n\r\nDocumentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements\r\n\r\nIf you've used ZUI 3, you might be somewhat familiar with what this looks like. the Custom Elements API allows developers to register their own elements, and define what that element looks like. For example, a well might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<zui-well>\r\n  <p>I'm a message</p>\r\n</zui-well>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** Custom Elements _hate_ conflict. You can't define two elements of the same name (the Internet will literally explode). This is an important thing to keep in mind when pulling in web components.\r\n\r\n#### Template\r\n\r\nDocumentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template\r\n\r\nCustom Elements use the `<template></template>` HTML element, which has existed long before this spec. This allows their registration to define what it looks like, without actually being rendered in the DOM.\r\n\r\n#### Slot\r\n\r\nDocumentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot\r\n\r\nThis \"element\" actually serves as a placeholder. When used with Custom Elements, it allows the consumer to add content inside of the custom element, and the custom element can then render it where and how it wants to. In the above zui-well example, the message actually will get \"slotted\" when rendered. If you take a peek at zui-well's definition, you'll see what this actually looks like.\r\n\r\n### Shadow DOM\r\n\r\nDocumentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM\r\n\r\nRemember how I mentioned that ZUI 4 is backwards compatible? Shadow DOM is what really ensures this.\r\n\r\nShadow DOM allows a custom element to encapsulate its styles and behavior. This means that zui-well doesn't need to worry about bleeding CSS (goodbye silly CSS classes, like `.zui-knockout-table__row`). Similarly, its Shadow DOM cannot be manipulated by the root DOM (and conversely, the custom element cannot manipulate the root DOM).\r\n\r\nEncapsulation is cool, ok. And legible CSS is even cooler.\r\n\r\n**Note:** What a badass name for a web feature, right?\r\n\r\n### CSS variables/custom properties\r\n\r\nDocumentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables\r\n\r\nNow, I know what you're thinking. Shadow DOM is scary; how can I style a custom element if its styles are encapsulated?!\r\n\r\nEnter CSS variables. With web components, CSS is an actual part of your custom element's API.\r\n\r\nmy-element.css\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:host {\r\n  background-color: var(--my-element-background, red);\r\n  /* var() unwraps --my-element-background, and if it doesn't exist, optionally falls back to red */\r\n\r\n  background-color: var(--my-element-background);\r\n  background-color: deleteme 30px;\r\n  /* is also valid; if `--my-element-background` isn't defined, `background-color` just won't be set */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\napplication.css\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  --my-element-background: green;\r\n  // set a CSS variable called --my-element-background to the color green\r\n}\r\n\r\np.wraps-my-element {\r\n  --my-element-background: blue;\r\n  // set a CSS variable called --my-element-background to the color blue\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nindex.html\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<body>\r\n  <my-element>I'm not red, but green!</my-element>\r\n  <p class=\"wraps-my-element\"><my-element>I'm not red, nor green, but blue!</my-element></p>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it. It's really that simple. The element declares a variable (`--my-element-background`), with a fallback value (`red`). Then, the consumer sets that variable via CSS, and voilÃ , you have provided a hook to style your custom element.\r\n\r\nCSS variables aren't just for custom elements. If you have a use case for them, they're really slick.\r\n\r\n**Note:** You can do some REALLY cool stuff with this; like easy theming, toggling a light/dark-mode, etc.\r\n\r\n### CustomEvent\r\n\r\nDocumentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent\r\n\r\nNot exactly part of the Web Component spec, but `CustomEvent` exists and allows us to create more DOM-like custom elements. They're actually really simple:\r\n\r\nmy-element.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\n...\r\nonPropChanged(newVal, oldVal) {\r\n    this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('propchanged', {\r\n        bubbles: true,\r\n        composed: true, // allows the event to be consumed outside the Shadow DOM\r\n        detail: { // allows you to define a payload for subscribers to consume\r\n            value: newVal\r\n        }\r\n    }));\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd from your application:\r\napp.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst myElement = document.querySelector(\"my-element\");\r\nmyElement.addEventListener(\"propchanged\", (event) => {\r\n  console.log(`Prop was changed to ${event.detail.value}`);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n</TabPage>\r\n<TabPage>\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\n[lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) is a very lightweight library whose sole purpose is to make updates to the DOM as cheap as possible. It uses a feature of JavaScript called [tagged template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literal#Tagged_templates) to be able to efficiently rerender only the portion of the DOM that actually needs to be updated (unlike other libraries, such as React, that use a technique called the \"Virtual DOM\", or \"VDOM\"). I won't bore you with all of the extra details, but if you're interested, it's worth reading [their documentation](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/).\r\n\r\n[LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) builds on top of lit-html to make developing performant custom elements a piece of cake. It exposes a class called `LitElement` that implementers should extend. That class has a protected method, `render()`, that must be implemented and is the hook for a custom element to dynamically render its DOM via lit-html's `` html` ` `` template literal tag.\r\n\r\nWe'll refer to both of these libraries together as lit :fire:\r\n\r\n## Why lit?\r\n\r\nThe ZUI group evaluated several web component libraries; we actually came pretty close to doing Polymer itself. Luckily, we came in right as lit-html was taking off, so we got the cheaper, better cousin to Polymer.\r\n\r\nWe also considered just extending HTMLElement and writing our own elements, but the boilerplate to get one of those off the ground is insane, especially when you consider some of the more complex components we have in our toolkit.\r\n\r\n## Useful Links\r\n\r\n| Name                     | Link                                                                                | Note                                                                                                                                                                      |\r\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| lit-html documentation   | https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/                                               | Official documentation for lit-html                                                                                                                                       |\r\n| LitElement documentation | https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/                                            | Official documentation for LitElement                                                                                                                                     |\r\n| lit-html repo            | https://github.com/polymer/lit-html                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                           |\r\n| LitElement repo          | https://github.com/polymer/lit-element                                              |                                                                                                                                                                           |\r\n| Polymer Slack            | https://polymer.slack.com <br /> registration: https://polymer-slack.herokuapp.com/ | Official Polymer chat; many Polymer devs sit in the channel watching discussion and participate when they can.

But, if you're curious, here's everything that needs to exist for ZUI to work in the browser that shall not be named.\r\n\r\n<Spacer/>\r\n\r\n## Required polyfills\r\n\r\n### [@webcomponents/webcomponentjs](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs)\r\n\r\nUntil [this chart](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1) shows all green for browsers we support, you'll need this library. Don't worry, it does feature detection, so as browsers start supporting more and more, the polyfill will get lighter and lighter.\r\n\r\n99% of the time, you can just pull in `webcomponents-loader.js` and you're good to go. However, if you're using Babel (or some comparable transpiler) to get ZUI to be consumable by [a browser that doesn't recognize ES6 classes](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-class), you'll ALSO need to pull in `custom-elements-es5-adapter.js`, and ONLY pull it in browsers that understand what a custom element is (so for most of you, that's all browsers except Internet Explorer 11 and Edge).\r\n\r\nIt's highly recommended that you deliver ES6 class transpiled ZUI to Internet Explorer 11 and Edge, and native ES6 classes to everyone else. But, that's on you.\r\n\r\n<Spacer size=\"small\"/>\r\n\r\n### Promise polyfill\r\n\r\nIf targeting Internet Explorer 11, you'll need a promise polyfill. There's no shortage of options on this front; if you don't explicitly load your own promise polyfill, `@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs` will give you [promise-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise-polyfill).\r\n\r\n<Spacer size=\"small\"/>\r\n\r\n### [@webcomponents/shadycss](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/shadycss)\r\n\r\nFor Internet Explorer 11 and Edge, you'll need to do the following:\r\n\r\n- Install [@zywave/zui-custom-style](https://packages.zywave.com/feeds/private-npm/@zywave/zui-custom-style/)\r\n- Install [@webcomponents/shadycss](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/shadycss)\r\n  - You'll get this for free, but you'll need to include `custom-style-interface.min.js` in your index file. This is where the magic happens.\r\n- **Preferred method**: Wrap your important CSS custom properties in the document like in the example below.\r\n- Your stylesheet imports (`<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"application.css\" />`) will need to be switched to `<zui-custom-stylesheet href=\"application.css\"></zui-custom-stylesheet>` if they contain CSS custom properties (e.g. `--zui-button-color: green;`).\r\n  - **Note:** Please, only use this if the browser is Internet Explorer 11 or Edge; we can't guarantee that any performance enhancements the browsers provide for `rel=\"stylesheet\"` is properly replicated. For starters, you're blocked by the main thread so that JavaScript can be loaded and executed before your styles can even be loaded. Not cool.\r\n  - There are some really weird race conditions with this one. If you see issues, log it to ZUI's issue here: https://gitlab.zywave.com/zui/zui/issues/201\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<zui-custom-style>\r\n  <style>\r\n    html {\r\n      --zui-shell-primary-theme: #2e2e2e;\r\n      --zui-shell-primary-theme-dark: #2e2e2e;\r\n      --zui-shell-profile-avatar-background: #51515a;\r\n    }\r\n  </style>\r\n</zui-custom-style>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<zui-well type=\"info\" no-animation>\r\n\r\nEven if you use the `zui-loader.js`, you still need to wrap all CSS custom properties in `<zui-custom-style></zui-custom-style>` in your applications if you want them to work in Internet Explorer 11.\r\n\r\n</zui-well>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Polyfilling ZUI Colors and other CSS custom properties\r\n\r\nCSS custom properties, also known as CSS variables, are not supported in Internet Explorer 11 and never will be. If you want to use static CSS custom properties&mdash;such as our ZUI Colors&mdash;in your applications and cannot wrap them in `<zui-custom-style>`, consider installing [@postcss/postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties). This polyfill will provide fallback values for style properties in Internet Explorer 11.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  --zui-red-400: #ee562f;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.error-text {\r\n  color: var(--zui-red-400);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* becomes */\r\n\r\n:root {\r\n  --zui-red-400: #ee562f;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.error-text {\r\n  color: #ee562f;\r\n  color: var(--zui-red-400);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<zui-well type=\"warning\" no-animation>\r\n\r\n`postcss-custom-properties` doesn't support dynamic CSS variables. Whatever value is defined at the root level will be the final output.\r\n\r\n</zui-well>\r\n\r\n</TabPage>\r\n<TabPage>\r\n\r\nThe ZUI monorepo uses a large number of tools, from building distributable packages to hosting the ZUI documentation website. Here's a brief overview of everything you need to know. This is not an exhaustive list, but should get you the essentials.\r\n\r\n## CLI Tools\r\n\r\nThis project uses a lot of CLI tools, some you may or may not be familiar with. With the exception of a small handful, all CLI tools are installed and managed as devDependencies of the workspace. This means that you should try to use [npx](./getting-started/about-tech/#npx) with those tools.\r\n\r\n### Yarn\r\n\r\nPackage manager of choice. Has its own support for workspaces and has some caching/efficiencies that make it more appealing over npm.\r\n\r\n#### Useful commands:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n> yarn add ${package} ### adds ${package} as a dependency\r\n> yarn add ${package} -D ### add ${package} as a devDependency\r\n> yarn install ### installs all dependencies of a yarn project (or will create a yarn.lock file if not already existing)\r\n> yarn -W add ${package} ### adds ${package} as a dependency to a workspace's root package.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Pro tip**: Can't tell if the project you're working on is using yarn or npm? If there's a yarn.lock file, it uses yarn.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://www.yarnpkg.com/)\r\n\r\n### Lerna\r\n\r\nThe glue that holds the entire monorepo together.\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed at this point that ALL of ZUI is in this single repository. Well, lerna is the tool we use that helps facilitate:\r\n\r\n1.  building all the packages\r\n1.  publishing all the packages\r\n1.  using unpublished dependencies while in development\r\n    - It uses some cool symlinking to simulate a proper node dependency tree. If you're ever curious, check out the root's `node_modules/@zywave/` folder\r\n\r\n#### Useful commands:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n> lerna bootstrap ### runs yarn install and links all monorepo packages that have dependencies\r\n> lerna add ${package} --scope=@zywave/* ### adds ${package} to all packages in the monorepo that match the scope pattern (so all packages that start with @zywave/*)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://lernajs.io/)\r\n\r\n### Gulp\r\n\r\nTask library that is similar to Grunt, but built around filestream pipelines.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://gulpjs.com/)\r\n\r\n### Gridsome\r\n\r\nStatic website generator, based on Vue.js. Create a site like a Vue app, and then Gridsome attempts to compile away the framework into a static site.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://gridsome.org/)\r\n\r\n### npx\r\n\r\nAllows you to run another CLI tool from either a node/yarn project's dependencies, or your global space if not available. Very useful for ensuring that the build tooling you use for a project is the way the author(s) intended.\r\n\r\nThis tool has been a part of Node since Node 8.2.0 (it actually gets installed with npm after npm 5.2.0).\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://github.com/zkat/npx)\r\n\r\n### Typescript / TSC\r\n\r\nMost of the repo is written in Typescript. TSC is typescript's CLI for transpiling .ts files into .js.\r\n\r\n### Yeoman\r\n\r\nJavascript template generation. Only needed if you want to create a new package based off of the provided templates.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](http://yeoman.io/)\r\n\r\n## Supplemental tooling\r\n\r\n### Browsersync\r\n\r\n_Hitting F5 is so 2017._\r\n\r\nA really cool server that will watch files for changes and refresh the browser if anything changes. Used in a lot of our `gulp watch` pipelines.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://www.browsersync.io/)\r\n\r\n### ESLint\r\n\r\n_No, you shouldn't litter `console.log` everywhere. Stop that._\r\n\r\nESLint ensures that we code using similar design patterns and helps us catch potential problems early.\r\n\r\nThis is configured in the repo's .eslintrc.json and .eslintignore.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://eslint.org/)\r\n\r\n### ES Dev Server\r\n\r\nA web server for development without bundling, useful for non Gulp dependent packages.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://open-wc.org/developing/es-dev-server.html)\r\n\r\n### Husky / Lint-staged\r\n\r\n_No, you can't commit your ugly code._\r\n\r\nThe build server will lint our code (using a variety of linting tools); these two together help you maintain sanity by running the linting prior to commit. They'll even fix your code and stage that for you so that you hardly have to lift a finger!\r\n\r\n[Husky documentation](https://github.com/typicode/husky)\r\n\r\n[Lint-staged documentation](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)\r\n\r\n### Karma / Mocha / Chai\r\n\r\n_Testing 1,2,3._\r\n\r\nAutomated testing tools for Typescript and Javascript.\r\n\r\nKarma provides a CLI and runs tests in real browsers, Mocha is a framework for writing tests, and Chai is an assertion library.\r\n\r\n[Karma documentation](https://karma-runner.github.io/5.0/intro/how-it-works.html)\r\n[Mocha documentation](https://mochajs.org/)\r\n[Chai documentation](https://www.chaijs.com/)\r\n\r\n### Node-sass\r\n\r\nSass compiler wrapping Libsass (a C++ alternative to the Ruby Sass compiler).\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)\r\n\r\n### Polyserve\r\n\r\nServer maintained by the Polymer team that handles on-the-fly ES module resolution and other niceties.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/polyserve)\r\n\r\n### Prettier\r\n\r\n_Tabs vs spaces? Who really cares?_\r\n\r\nPrettier is a file formatting tool that keeps us using similar file syntaxes (e.g. using spaces instead of tabs, single quotes instead of double, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis is configured in the monorepo's .prettierrc file, and requires an additional plugin to play nicely with ESLint.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html)\r\n\r\n</TabPage>\r\n</Tabs>\r\n","component":"","subComponent":"","zuiLayoutLargerWidth":null}},"context":{}}
