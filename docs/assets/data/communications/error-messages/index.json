Each error should have a unique message that provides the user with a clear understanding of what caused the error and what their next steps might be. Depending on the scenario in which they encounter the error, this message could be presented using a few different delivery systems.\n\n<spacer size=\"small\" />\n\n## 401 - Unauthorized\n\nA user would encounter the 401 - unauthorized error when we don't recognize them. This typically indicates that the requested resource is restricted and requires authentication, but the client failed to provide any such authentication or we failed to authenticate them.\n\n![401 error](/images/communications/messages/401-error-message.svg)\n\n### Implementation details\n\n| Scenario                                                                                                                       | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| The entire product isn't available unless a user is authenticated.                                                             | Make the product require authentication for anywhere a user is trying to access.

Typically, this indicates that the user tried to navigate to an invalid resource ID or that the resource was deleted.\n\nThis message can be presented as either a banner well or a full-page error that has the Zywave Shell available to the user.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Implementation details\n\n##### Banner well\n\nThe banner well error text and links are customizable by the consumer. The text should be clear and concise, providing our users with an understanding of what caused the error and what their next steps are. The link can be customized to provide the user with a path to resolve the error, such as contacting Zywave support. However, because the user remains on the current page and are able to navigate freely, the link is optional and should be used sparingly.\n\n| Scenario                                    | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| A user selects a resource that was deleted. | The user encounters a 404 error banner well stating that the resource cannot be found.

The text should be clear and concise, providing our users with an understanding of what caused the error and what their next steps are. The links should be customized to provide the user with at least one path to continue working within our products. The path that they are sent to should make sense based on where they encountered the error within Zywave when possible.\n\nWhile we hope that the messaging and links provided will be enough to assist the user, a link to the Zywave Support site should always be included.\n\nAlong with this information, if the resource has an ID number associated with it, this should be displayed to allow the administrator or Zywave support specialist to better assist the user.\n\n| Scenario                                                          | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| A user enters or attempts to navigate to an invalid resource key. | The user encounters a 404 page stating that the resource cannot be found.

The 500 error is a \"server-side\" error which means there is a problem with the products' server but the server could not be more specific on the exact problem. In most cases, the user will just have to wait until we fix the issue but there are a few things a user can do as the issue can only be temporary:\n\n- Clear the cache and delete any cookies from the page with the error\n\n- Clear browser history\n\n- Retry the page by clicking refresh or reload\n\n- Retype the URL in the address bar and press enter\n\n- Come back to the page later when the issue has been resolved\n\nBeing that a 500 error is \"server-side\", the problem is most likely your problem. Some of the common reasons you may be serving a 500 error to your users are:\n\n- Permission error\n\n- Request timeout\n\n- A coding error\n\n<spacer size=\"small\" />\n\n### Implementation details\n\nThis message is presented as a full-page error that has the Zywave Shell available to the user.\n\nOur standard 500 error image should appear at the top center of the page.\n\nThe text should be clear and concise, providing our users with an understanding of what caused the error and what their next steps are.
